🔍 Data Loading & Preprocessing

Loading the Data
Before performing any data preprocessing or model training, we begin by loading the dataset and conducting an initial inspection.

Steps:

✅ Load the dataset: Read the weather data from a CSV file using Pandas.
✅ Check data types: Displaying column data types helps us understand the dataset structure.
✅ Inspect the first data point: Print all feature values of the first record to get an overview of the dataset content.
✅ Check dataset dimensions: Print the dataset shape to determine the number of rows and columns.
